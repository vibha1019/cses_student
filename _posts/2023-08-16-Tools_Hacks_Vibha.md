## Cool Hacks to Style Your Website!

# Rounded Corners
Rounding the corners of the background of your text is a very modern way to make the visuals more appealing. People are obsessed with rounded corners after Apple, so it's a great way to style your website. The syntax is below. The value can be any amount, with the higher the value the rounder the corner. I prefer 20 px, but feel free to round your corners as much as you want!

```css
div {
    border-radius: 20px;
}
