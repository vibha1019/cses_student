#Hamsters!

Hamsters are furry, small, rodents that are often energetic. They make great first time pets, as they are low maintenance and small in size!

##Pros
The pros of owning a hamster is plentiful. They provide emotional support and help with the release of serotonin. Although they look scary, they are actually harmless, if you keep them in a locked glass box.

##Cons
The cons of owning a hamster is actually quite depressing. Some hamsters are suicidal and need more emotional support from their owners. It is reccomended that your hamster has gotten a mental health screening before you adopt it

##Diet 
Hamsters live in isolation, so they eat what is available to them. In many cases it is their family/children if desperate for proper nutrition. However, hamsters do enjoy cheese balls and canned corn. They enjoy the gamer diet.
